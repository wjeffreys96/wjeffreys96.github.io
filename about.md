I'm a software developer based in Portland, Oregon. I received a certificate in web development from Portland Community College in 2019 and have been teaching myself since.

I have in depth experience in React and Django, and genuinely enjoy using both.

I've also been making music for about 20 years now and have a passion for sound design and audio engineering.

I use Ableton as my DAW, Izotope and Fabfilter products for mixing tools, and Splice and Xfer Serum for sound design.
